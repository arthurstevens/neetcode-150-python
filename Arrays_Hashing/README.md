| Contains Duplicate  | Set                             | - Sets have a slightly lower overhead than dictionaries as the keys are stored without a value pair.<br>- Sets inherently do not include duplicates, so construction of a set from the list and comparing the lengths garnered optimal runtime from avoiding key lookups and fast set construction.
